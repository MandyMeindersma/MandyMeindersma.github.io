# My submission:
**Project:** https://www.mandymeindersma.com/MTAOpenDataChallenge/ 

**Data set used:** https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Subway-Entrances-and-Exits-2024/i9wp-a4ja/about_data 

**Name of contributors:** Mandy Meindersma

**Description:** I created a fun brain teaser map visualization using the data of subway entrances and exits! Would you guess that a stop on the 1/2/3 line at 96th street is more west than the southern tip of manhattan? The 1/2/3 route does run along the west side of Manhattan so many would guess it is more west. I made a visualization to give some insight on that theory! As we are walking around Manhattan we tend to use the grid system to determine direction but this map helps us see the solution based off of the cardinal directions.

I used an open source map library called Leaflet to create an interactive map and show visualizations. I found Leaflet to be very user friendly and very performant.

I added extra documentation on the site to explain the brain teaser part of the map, extra documentation in my project README as well as documentation throughout my code.
