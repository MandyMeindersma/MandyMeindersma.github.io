# My submission:
**Project:** https://www.mandymeindersma.com/MTAOpenDataChallenge/ 
**Name of contributors:** Mandy Meindersma
**Description:** I created a fun brain teaser map visualization using the subway entrances and exits data! Would you guess that a stop on the 1/2/3 at 96th street is more west than the middle tip of manhattan? The 1/2/3 route does go on the west side of Manhattan so many would guess it is more west. I made a visualization to give some insight on that theory! 

I used an open source map library called Leaflet to create an interactive map and show visualizations. I find Leaflet to be very user friendly and very performant.

I added extra documentation on the site to explain the brain teaser part of the map, extra documentation in my project README as well as documentation throughout my code.
**Data set used:** https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Subway-Entrances-and-Exits-2024/i9wp-a4ja/about_data
