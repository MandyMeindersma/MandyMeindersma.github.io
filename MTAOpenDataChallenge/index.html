        <h1>
            How well do you know your East and West? 
        </h1>
        <h1>
            Is point A to the West of point B? or vice versa?
        </h1>
        <p>
            I created this fun view of New York City to show how warped our view of West and East is when we are on the island. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When you are on the island your view of East and West usually lines up with the grid system. 
            So when you turn the map below to the side a little you can imagine that near <b>the top of the 1/2/3 line (point A) 
            seems more West than the tip of Manhattan (point B).</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Now with this map you can see the column divisions trying to visually illustrate what is actually "more West" than something else. 
            With this view of the map we can see that <b>point B is actually West of Point A.</b>
