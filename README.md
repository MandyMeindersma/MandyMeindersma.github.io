Hello! This is my personal webpage. I first made this in my second year of university. I got a theme from bootstrap and have been editing it ever since.

### Lighthouse:
My Google lighthouse performance, accessibility and SEO (search engine optimization) scores *used to* be pretty great (all over 97) but then they included Largest Contentful Paint and Cumulative Layout Shift in the metrics and I can't figure out how to fix the things :P. Everything else is at 100 though.

### Development:
* npm install gulp-cli -g
* npm install gulp-less
* npm install gulp -D
* npm install gulp-connect
* npm install gulp-livereload
* run `gulp dev` in command line to see live changes
