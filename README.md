Hello! This is my personal webpage. I first made this in my second year of university. I got a theme from bootstrap and have been editing it ever since. My Google lighthouse performance, accessibility and SEO (search engine optimization) scores are pretty great (all over 97 last I checked).

### Development:
* npm install gulp-cli -g
* npm install gulp -D
* npm install gulp-connect
* npm install gulp-livereload
* run `gulp dev` in command line to see live changes

### [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) - [Freelancer](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/)

[Freelancer](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/) is a one page freelancer portfolio theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/). This theme features several content sections, a responsive portfolio grid with hover effects, full page portfolio item modals, and a working PHP contact form.
